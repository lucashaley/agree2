# We Agree That…

We Agree That… is an experiment in crowd-sourced axiomatic opinion.

## Heroku Deployment

This is also my first experiment in deploying to Heroku.

### My own notes:

* remember to login to Heroku in the CL by using `heroku login`
* adding an existing dir to existing project: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5129598/how-to-link-a-folder-with-an-existing-heroku-app
* google var buildpack: https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/elishaterada/heroku-google-application-credentials-buildpack
