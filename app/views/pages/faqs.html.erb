          <p>This site is idealogically driven to find areas where we <strong>can</strong> agree, not where we <strong>can't</strong>. As such, I'm not interested in implementing a "disagree" option.</p>
          <p>Instead, I encourage users who disagree with a statement to <em>create a new variant</em> that they do agree with.</p>
          <p>That way, the process is more about constructively finding points of agreement, rather than just cutting statements down.</p>

          <p>I'm not interested in tracking users. Marketing isn't a thing for me.</p>
          <p>From a UX standpoint, I also don't want to have authentication, as it's an unnecessary hurdle to giving your opinion. However, I do want to limit excessive abuse of voting, so I have implemented a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">fingerprint</a> system.</p>
          <p>So, there's that.</p>

          <p>Because it's super easy to disagree with people. It's much more difficult to agree. I want to see if we can change that in some way.</p>
